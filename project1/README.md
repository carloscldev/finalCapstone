Project I - Variables and Control Structures
This program converts temperature from Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin.

Usage
The program first prompts the user to choose the current metric using the prompt() function. The input is then converted to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. If the user enters an invalid metric, the program will repeat the input until a valid input is entered.

Next, the user is prompted to enter the temperature they wish to convert using the prompt() function. The program checks if the input is a number using the isNaN() function. If the input is not a number, the program will output an error message.

The user is then prompted to choose the metric they wish to convert the temperature to. The input is then converted to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method. If the user enters an invalid metric, the program will repeat the input until a valid input is entered.

The program then uses the conversion formulas defined at the beginning of the program to convert the temperature. The final converted temperature is output to the console.

Resources
This program makes use of the prompt(), toUpperCase(), isNaN(), and console.log() functions.

This program also makes use of the while loop statement. More information on the while loop can be found on the MDN web docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while
