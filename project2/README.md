## Project Title
Capstone Project II - Arrays, Functions, and String Handling

## Description
This program, written in JavaScript, encodes a message by shifting each letter by 15 places in a closed cycle (A-Z) and (a-z). All other characters, such as spaces and punctuation, remain the same. The program utilizes arrays and string handling techniques to iterate through the characters of the message and shift their positions.

## How to Use

* Clone or download the repository
* Open the cypher.js file in a code editor
* Run the program in a JavaScript environment (e.g. Node.js)
* Enter a message to be encoded when prompted
* The encoded message will be printed to the console
