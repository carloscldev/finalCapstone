Capstone Project III - OOP

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in the context of a sales department. The project includes three classes:

Employee: represents an employee in the sales department. It has a calculatePayout() method that calculates the payout for the employee based on the type of employee, and a displayPayout() method that displays the name, type, and payout of the employee.

SalariedEmployee: represents a salaried employee in the sales department. It inherits from the Employee class and adds a salary property.

HourlyEmployee: represents an hourly employee in the sales department. It inherits from the Employee class and adds an hourly rate and hours worked properties.

HybridEmployee: represents a hybrid employee in the sales department. It inherits from the Employee class and adds a salary and hourly rate properties.

The project also includes sample code that creates instances of the different kinds of employees and displays the payout for each employee.
