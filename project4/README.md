Capstone Project IV -- Create a Web page using HTML and CSS

## Description

Welcome to the repository for my Capstone Project IV. The project's goal is to create a web page using HTML and CSS, with the topic of "Cooking as a Hobby". The website is designed to showcase various recipes, cooking tips and resources for home cooks.

## The website consists of 5 pages:

* index.html - The homepage of the website, containing a brief introduction and a showcase of the latest recipes.
* recipes.html - A page containing a collection of various recipes.
* resources.html - A page containing helpful tips and resources for home cooks.
* about.html - A page containing information about the website and its creators.
* contact.html - A page containing a contact form for visitors to reach out to the website's creators.
* The website also includes a stylesheet, style.css, which is used to apply a consistent design across all pages.
